# Discord.js Bot with Database and React Dashboard
This is a Discord.js bot that uses a database to store data and has a React dashboard for managing the bot. Each folder has a README.md file with more information about that folder.

## Requirements
- Node.js
- Discord.js
- Database (e.g., MySQL (XAMPP), PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- React
- Installation 
    - ```npm i```
- Clone this repository.

### Start the bot:

`node .` or `nodemon`

Nodemon is not installed by default and can be installed by running the following command in the terminal:

`npm i -g nodemon`

The bot will automatically restart when you make changes to the code and hit save (CTRL + S).

### Start the dashboard:

`npm start`

## Usage
Once the bot is running, you can start using it by adding it to your Discord server. Once the bot has been added to your server, you can start using its commands.

## Dashboard
The dashboard can be used to manage the bot. It allows you to view and edit the bot's settings, as well as view and manage the bot's data.

To access the dashboard, go to the following URL in your web browser:

`http://localhost:3000 `
